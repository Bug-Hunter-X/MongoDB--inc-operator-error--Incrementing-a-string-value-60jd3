# MongoDB $inc Operator Error: Incrementing String Value

This example demonstrates an error that can occur when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specified value. However, if you attempt to increment a field that is not a number or contains a string value, the update operation will not produce the expected results. The solution shows the proper way to use the `$inc` operator and handle potential data type issues.

## Bug Description

The bug involves incorrectly using the `$inc` operator to increment a string value. When the `$inc` operator receives a string, it interprets it as an attempt to increment a string value, resulting in an unexpected outcome. The update operation will either fail or produce incorrect results.  

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the value to be incremented is a valid number before applying the `$inc` operator.
